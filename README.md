# Mutational Analysis at Genomic Level between SARS CoV-2 Variants 

In this study, I am developing scripts to understand the mutations at genomic level between SARS CoV-2 variants. Understandning the mutationaln pattern of SARS CoV-2 is important because it gives the insights about the pathogenesis and how the pathogenesis pathway can be different for each variants. 

I am planning to retrieve the sequences from NCBI and GISAID databases. After considering the sequences with best coverages, the scripts will be focused on tracking the mutation of each gene among different sequences.
